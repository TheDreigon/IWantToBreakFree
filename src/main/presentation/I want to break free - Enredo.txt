===== ROTEIRO APRESENTAÇÃO ======
Trilha inicial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwFALMf7CNw


One upon a time, a joyful woman was living in the great city of Fundão.

But she had something special…

Not because of her Brazilian boyfriend… (one boyfriend appears from one of the front doors)

But 2 Brazilian boyfriends!! (The other one appears from the other front door)


Life was great for little Jojo…


…if wasn’t for that dark secret. So dark, that even her boyfriends didn’t know about it.

But what could that be?

(Boyfriends leave and let Jojo alone. Jojo starts to smoke a cigar)

Oh, my God! That’s it! Jojo is addicted to cigarrets!

What a bad thing, Jojo, don’t do that… (Jojo makes a grimace for the speaker)

Did you know that governments from all over the world spend millions on healthcare related to smoking issues?

(Jojo makes a “poker face”, not caring about the speaker)

Well, you still don’t care, do you? What would your boyfriends say about that?

(Jojo still don’t care about the speaker)

Hey, don’t be like that… you really should… (boyfriends came back in the room and became disappointed with Jojo. They leave and Jojo starts to cry)

(Jojo gets depressed and smoking more)

And then little Jojo went into a downfall of addiction. She couldn’t care for nothing else anymore… even for poneis…

Then, out of a sudden, Jojo crosses one guy on the street and decides to ask:

- Please, wise man, could you guide me out of this unpleasant addiction?
- Dear child, what do you want for your life?

(Jojo stops for a moment and says:)

- Sir, https://youtu.be/f4Mc-NYPHaQ?t=45 (I want to break free!! - the audio speaks for Jojo)

Everybody on the room starts and are invited to dance. After some seconds, the music stops and the acting returns:

- Then, my child, I’ll give you the most important tip I received in my youth, from a programming bootcamp in a far, far away land…
- Thank you so much, sir! And what would that be?
- “Google it!”

Immediately, Jojo went back home as fast as she could to research. And then she found:


https://youtu.be/f4Mc-NYPHaQ?t=45  (I WANT TO BREAK FREE!!!!)  - Claps

(The team - except the introducer, who goes to the front - goes to the back of the room to be introduced. When announced, each one walks around the room clapping other’s hands)

Hey, but wait… what happened to Jojo?

(Jojo appears, happy and dancing)

Oh, there she is: living the most happier days of her life…

Good to see you joyful again, Jojo! I could swear that you are in love…

(Jojo nods her head in affirmation.
Old boyfriends appears around)

That’s excellent, Jojo!! Did you managed to get back with your old boyfriends?

(Jojo nods “no”.
Boyfriends are fighting on the background for her)

Really? But you look even happier!! Hmmm… wait… Ah, I got it… so you found someone who’s better than 2 guys, right?

(Jojo happily nods “yes”.
Boyfriends are still fighting and trying to reach her)

Good for you, girl! So, who’s the lucky one?

(Jojo goes to another woman - Sara - grabs her and goes away)

Cu’ caracas! And that’s what I call a true champion!
